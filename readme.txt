An interactive Pentago game! Featuring 2 player mode or versus AI. 
AI is default set to an alpha beta algorithm. To change this to minmax algorithm uncomment line 168 and comment out line 169 in Pentago.py.
Ai is by default set to examine moves to depth 2. To change this set variable maxDepth in main in Pentago.py.

Minmax Algorithm
	Depth Level = 1
	Number of nodes expanded on first move = 288
	
	Depth Level = 2
	Number of nodes expanded = 80928

AlphaBeta Algorithm
	Depth Level = 1
	Number of nodes expanded = 288
	
	Depth level = 2
	Number of nodes expanded = 855
